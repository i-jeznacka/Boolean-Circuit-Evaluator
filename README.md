# Concurrent Boolean Circuit Evaluator
A project completed for Concurrent Programming course during 3rd semester of Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

This project implements concurrent evaluation of Boolean expressions ( `true`, `false`, `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, `IF`, `GTx`, `LTx`) represented as tree-structured circuits. It supports parallel computation of subexpressions, lazy evaluation (short-circuiting), and safe interruption.

The `circuit/` and `demo/` directories contains starter code provided by the university. 

Technologies used: Java, java.util.concurrent.
